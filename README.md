>A minecraft server plugin for practice Blockin.

### 1. Instructions

#### 目前只在1.20做测试，因为低版本的API真的很少，未来可能会支持低版本。~~(其实是我懒啦qwq)~~
#### At present, it is only tested in version 1.20, because there are  few APIs in the lower versions, and the lower versions may be supported in the future. ~~(because I'm lazy)~~

### 2. Overview

 - /bp addIsland [islandName] → Add an island.
 - /bp editMode → Toggle the editing mode.
 - /bp help → Show help.
 - /bp setBed [islandId] → Stand on the red bed and type this to set the bed position.
 - /bp setSpawn → Sets the world spawn point.
 - /bp setWaypoint [islandId] → Set island waypoint(This must be some distance above the coordinates of the bed.)
 
### 3. Apology

 - While making the plugin, due to a bug of mine, it currently only works properly in the Overworld and will be fixed in the next official release.
 - I'm a Java beginner, and there may be a lot of unreasonable code in the project. You can suggest changes to me.
 - Due to time constraints, there is currently no i18n of this plugin, which is why I have open-sourced it, I hope you can understand me.
 - This readme was written in a hurry, as this is only a preview version, and I will update it when the official version is released.
 - 在制作插件时由于一个错误，这个插件目前仅在主世界中正常运行，将在下一个正式版本中修复。
 - 我是一个Java初学者，项目中可能有很多不合理的代码，你可以向我提出更改建议。
 - 由于时间关系，目前这个插件没有国际化，这也是我开源的原因，望理解。
 - 这个自述文件写的很仓促，因为这只是一个预览版本，我将会在正式版本发布时更新它。
